\description{
A dataset formed by extracting information from the surveys conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences in 2017 (link provided as a source). These surveys are conducted annually by NCES () to gather information from every postsecondary institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs.
}
\details{
This dataset represents a population of both degree-granting and non-degree-granting active post-secondary institutions of all levels and sectors. It includes public, private for-profit, and private not-for-profit institutions. The vast majority of institutions in the dataset are Title IV institutions (which participate in federal financial aid programs), although some non-Title IV institutions participate as well.
