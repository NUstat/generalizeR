\title{Calculate Generalizability Index}
\usage{
gen_index(trial_ps, pop_ps)
}
\arguments{
\item{trial_ps}{vector of probabilities of sample participation among individuals in the trial}

\item{pop_ps}{vector of probabilities of sample participation among individuals in the population}
}
\value{
the generalizability index, a value between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates greater similarity
}
\description{
This function is easiest to use through 'assess()' but can also be used independently.
}
\details{
It calculates the generalizability index, a value between 0 and 1, that represents how generalizable a given sample is to a given population on specified covariates. For more information on calculation and interpretation, please see Tipton (2014).
