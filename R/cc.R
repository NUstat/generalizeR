#' CCD (Common Core of Data), 2017
#'
#' The Common Core of Data (CCD) is a national statistical program that collects and compiles administrative data from state education agencies covering the universe of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the United States. The first CCD collection was for School Year 1986â€“87. The predecessor to CCD was the Elementary and Secondary General Information System.
#'
#' This dataset corresponds to the year 2017. It is a compilation of variables downloaded from the data files at https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/. It attempts to cover most demographic variables about the schools.
#'
#' The CCD data are often used as a sampling frame for studies of public elementary/secondary education. NCES studies that use the CCD this way include the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS). This package exists to make a sample of the CCD data easy to access for use with the package "generalizeR."
